interesting project incorporate safety safety safety first youre thinking Electronics youre probably thinking know electricity dangerous lot great resource understand make environment safe home take apart Electronics kit includes safety precaution great resource local Makerspace hackerspaces Community meetups go meet Cam youll find wonderful local group get together work project ranging various citizen science initiative bioengineering even building rocket ship resource really like guide set maker type space go instructablescom lot project idea crowdsourced community Google making DIY Im sure youll come lot resource go CC youre worried cost incorporating steam classroom school setting thing think one project really dont expensive know think Electronics might think robot know Arduino thing definitely cost lot money know youre starting steam think keeping thing simple kid light LED first time delighted face literally light thats LED coin cell battery need funding resource like donor choose various education grant youre classroom setting go parent Association Im sure theyll happy help last know hear Educators concerned dont background science engineering concerned theyre right person facilitate project say correct absolutely period mission really empower parent Educators bring steam kid life know much fun kid thank much joining u video head CC youll find resource video stop video wanted say hello Tara please feel free add comment question want add conversation would delighted hear feel free email u hello atcc Twitter home hope see soon bye lot Educators contact u get started steam usually reply keep simple tip get started Ill make sure project goal clear dont expert Steam create steam project thats something emphasize Educators one way get started many lesson less 30 minute hand project using simple material get used teaching Steam also student used different type material available encourage Educators let student go whatever Direction want take project lot time student ask work way lot dont know answer none u know answer let student explore figure thats part steam supply important lot supply keep classroom library school space case student idea always bit material use another option use kit lot time kid involve Electronics material make easy student create project lot Educators think steam high school student maybe Middle School people think steam think robotics competition complicated project big take 10 week finish done team competition thats true get started younger kid Elementary School perfect kid want take risk theyre excited want make thing especially get take home thats excited share family teacher sometimes say cant get started teaching steam there enough time solution integrate seem subject becoming really important classroom steam crew becoming high demand really important find way teach steam Concepts even maybe one main subject even teach one subject integration provides higher platform student youre learning early American settler student study art period evaluate style piece reflect student know time period important provide opportunity reflect learning Steam lesson especially youre integrating help student gather thought integrated lesson make connection better integrating steam provides great opportunity student learn skill reflection synthesis skill important every subject thing Ive discovered classroom far integrating lesson kind kind Educators classroom integrate school educator parent well type steam project lesson really diverse commonly think steam activity active studentcentered three type lesson provide high level Engagement researchbased way teach steam subject HandsOn project easiest begin short simple theyre great classroom school type setting inquirybased lesson potentially involved require planning high payoff changing way student relate learning inquiry lesson prepare student steam career teaching sync solve problem teacher push student discover information act guide question thinking rather standing front telling student housing work really important thing teacher provide inquiry lesson making sure misconception steam thing work thing science work know math problem solved teacher act guide make sure student right track lastly processed space lesson mean student use process solve problem common process teacher use classroom scientific method use engineering process process evaluate process solve math problem create routine steam lesson kind mimic steam subject done real world steam requires material supply HandsOn project good news may already easily get supply need lot time youre school there construction paper pipe cleaner container cup use different type project easily go store buy way getting material asking student bring know recycled material like example cereal box container anything may available home bring make project usually like keep basic space like popsicle stick magnet battery duct tape different type container anything made project lot time people donate u material people know youre steam project theyll think want donate material collect could also take advantage online platform youre classroom teacher there donor choose crowdfunding platform raise buy something especially youre buying kit anything thats little bit expensive may available community thats extra tip one question get really frequently get girl engaged Steam know there different way may girl different think know find,2

put got filled send Tiffany Im going go ahead stick chat right get everybody good shape sound great Sooner everybody get turned Im getting facilitate learning instead directly incorporating attendance improves thing party really neat see happen soon Ive Incorporated know dont know anybody else issue math class people trying come late time dragging foot get class day project rushing get cuz want get access material first Project based learning really great job well discipline issue speak content area decreased discipline issue whenever project first time student would rather class opposed another class hard get student want math class play project excited want act better people class dont miss mine Ill honest teacher morale increased like said day project Im nearly exhausted end day refreshing see kid learning thing HandsOn there bunch great quality come Project based learning aspect first one tell mentioned beginning havent done math lesson yet think probably good reason seems like natural reaction literally super easy connection make math teacher know come time testing come time thing hard navigate away difficult try new thing youre weigh risk versus reward Ill first one tell think thats difficult dont seem people pressure state hard try new thing first reason think hard standard standard like said moving away procedural fluency conceptual fluency lot difficult teach really dive standard curriculum lot school district implementing dont leave lot room stuff know personally weve adapted new curriculum go 100 curriculum wouldnt done time Josey testing roll around there much youre district follow strictly doesnt leave lot time thing kind tie math teacher hand time teach geometry know barely enough time cover standard semester yearlong class schedule time length look Algebra 1 Algebra 2 standard Im sitting thinking world teacher twice many amount time cover material doesnt leave lot room know project last two three day understand understand struggle advertised hard get Math teacher project based learning Administration first tell Administration love see project tell test score run dont necessarily like project first thing go know weve got get back curriculum weve got get back thing almost fight incorporate stem sometimes Mass naturally lend instead project pressure math often restricts Im going say thing want know understand coming whenever come incorporating thing Im talking happen overnight can not immediately flip classroom 100 project thing like give Grace attempt one see go kind thing Ill first one tell dad approves project hinder test score anything helping however done correctly big big one go Teachers Pay Teachers thing like matter find greatlooking project stem math heart kind know teacher thats getting student need end course test challenging enough look great theyre probably going fun meat math maybe even project take four five day dont time worth long run make project count find project math classroom worth long run one thing rigorous thats kind main thing math worth youve got able right student need challenged whenever theyre project giving baby problem expecting great result going get know eocs tcat test come problem hard prepare student project themself hard well anything less wasting wasting precious time classroom also want look make sure looking instructional Focus document making sure whenever put project together looking thing hitting level one level two mask standard really hitting level three level four make sure getting conceptual understanding make sure student getting something time huge issue youve got make sure youre going spend two three day project got worth two three day valuable standing lecturing 2 3 day whatever assignment would make sure worth hindrance really unique balance accomplish last thing kind grade level thats one thing see lot whenever look stem project posted online teacher paste teacher theyre great really grade level need lot Im looking geometry project geometry stuff theyre probably 7th 8th grade level labeled high school making sure youre really evaluating grade level project lastly one biggest thing Im going project going count graded part need student know important important anything else Im going take time grade expect work expect well fun class yes hopefully fun u great project expect good work especially found honor student graded dont care nearly much test think waste time compared think getting ready test especially math class room lot student Matthew worksheet assignment listen lecture take test start deviating thing sometimes almost see reward doesnt matter kind thing almost like free day grade everything let know still standard Im holding kind help make adjustment projectbased learning Im going share everybody think best math stem project preparing wanted make sure kind math teacher could take something away whether elementary middle school high school glad specific geometry based project want holler later glad share concept used cross board kind math youre sooner get check absolutely want right want everybody get thats right right right well today 330 going go ahead get started respect everyones time thank joining today today Workshop incorporate steam math class missed Anna Shelton Peabody High School know body high school stem call coordinator shes also still classroom fulltime without Ado Im going turn Anna let excellent resource use quite bit escape room think Escape room perfect way tie math stand together still get rigor math puzzle critical thinking skill theyre actively learning well Im going talk little bit classroom math little bit first say lot Escape room lot escape room learned trial error kind make worth worth Ive fails Ive thing want share Ive done far Candyland theme actually classroom right Im look like normal daytoday basis tablecloth hung print Ive hung wall like here another one Ive done specifically Geometry kind look bottom picture see triangle directly covering standard murder mystery figure really hung tablecloth took tape taped man floor extent decoration puzzle math problem thing like like said looked classroom normal space size probably working next two however library youve ever Peabody High School youve ever kind heard u took traditional 1970s Library year back transformed stem maker space blessed point time able move furniture move thing around kind free space however need made Escape room much large scale theyre spread something classroom normally break student group whenever Im library entire group 30 kid allows space kind thing youll see monopoly one Ive done one DC Comics one kind thing next two see kind got new resource able get black light thing like kind elevate room little bit kind lot Escape room want make point Escape room lot thing geometry classroom Escape room stem class also community outreach event created Escape room something fairly regularly done many Escape room one year Geometry know like thats thats necessarily reason dont want anyone misconception idea come past like said adapted kid age able work elementary school kid Escape room weve done well much success learning well lot time think maybe hard thing like elementary school grade level type thing tremendous success little bit go process want make escape room go first one nothing new youre math teacher Im sure probably start unit anyway go ahead make unit test look standard look level make unit test whatever thats going look like okay next test Im going sort problem easy level medium level heart level reason like mentioned kind project worth rigor setting escape room taking time wasting entire day class baby work like thats worth opinion dont feel like student getting anything could done worksheet home easily got thing Im escape room material going difficult go think puzzle usually six puzzle six different clue thing like escape room find escape room usually plan hour time period long going take whenever set timer thats long give find depending unit Im asking medium hard level question usually get five puzzle one final puzzle Escape Room looking six different task puzzle one five using Concepts put test medium hard level question okay easy problem give Escape room theyre going get next step going work kind concept final final puzzle escape room pick something difficult anything else Ive put test multistep multiconcept first unit pulling Concepts past unit weve done cumulative review problem kind thing escaped kind going back problem creating puzzle Im going flip back slide second dont give anybody blast whenever move kind quick like said one right GE country class see first puzzle puzzle directly textbook looking triangle congruence go coded number different triangle congruence rule side angle side might represented know side side side side side made represented five code work problem would give three digit combination use 3 digit combination thing go unlock box padlock get next clue thats kind use Im going kind vast storytelling see Escape room know usually little print set scene little bit Im taking time away math okay math still main thing dont circus trick make make worth Im using math problem fact theyre unlocking box using black light thing like give element critical thinking need stem part still different hidden Clues thing like think critically use problem solving SIM card well key still math escape room unlock next box believe polaroid picture use problem back solve problem put together like puzzle piece took next clue another puzzle Ive done hide hide math problem

around Halloween spooky thing escape room build coffin escape room hit puzzle whatever theme pick something simple always start want point B want end kind work like said murder mystery knew thing wanted incorporate wanted use black light find hidden message want solve math problem end goal wanted able figure puzzle told first one later student one point unlocked box scissors could go find another box zip tie could cut zip tie think Im trying remember think unlock box bunch different people could Killer go solve math problem figure one theme still problem solving still kid kid working math well lot time whenever talk feedback Ive got teacher school Im creative enough dont know dont creativity factor promise mine much math problem youre recreating anything purely creating theme student get special dont anything super crazy think thats important know think kind unimaginable feed seems impossible youre still math youre still content area whats confidence different format present lastly build room usually like said take long maybe 20 minute youre planning anything take time youve got little bit time hand thats great hope hope turn well really lot 20 minute thats much take hang tablecloth set prop keep mind well like said Ive really found Escape room tie stem factor give kid rigor math without watering anything highly recommend havent tried like said Ive done several past Id happy share resource help anyone dont know get started like said Ill put email back end truly crazy see student normally like pulling teeth get math there one trying figure one rewarding thing see first time didnt escape room student kicking paying attention past four five day Ive teaching cuz dont know puzzle dont get next step next unit think going another escape room want make sure theyre able figure whenever come time get started kind two section first paper need lock padlock locked key different thing work type box folder Tupperware anything lock whatever first made first escape room even involved stem program 100 geometry teacher didnt ton resource didnt know reach literally went Walmart bought three lock took old Tupperware container home melted hole could

interested smoke machine always fun get hold one glow paint black light excellent space themed room showed earlier stuff done blacklight paint lastly prop like said active stem program even active AG program could make resource highly recommend reaching give student class ownership adding element class kind cool student realize hey made class kind went presentation knew could pick project directly relate geometry could pick different thing wanted something everyone could take something away really think Escape room tie stem also let higher order thinking mouth content area whatever may like said go cross curricular want English classroom itll still work youll adapt curriculum think great think something everyone try least Ive got one thing want talk move anyone direct question Escape room anything like go let see aha go right get started kind introduced little bit active coordinator district work alongside high school middle school Trenton elementary school well come stem Im really kind hand level district dont know maybe teacher Elementary Middle High School kind dabble little bit kind geared today well something sorry computer underutilized category think happens incorporated think general use stem class really major effect score say teacher test subject actively use stem class help math thats know best knew English would helping English teacher happen know math something try push stem class talked earlier restriction Math teacher kind pressure dont get leniency trying crazy fun thing dont time pressure much try deviate thing know stuff work think stim great Avenue thing review math regular Math teacher dont time kind mean stem class think engineering project experiment stuff yes thats great whenever assume teacher using correct academic language talking kind project stem class working circle dont need call edge circle need referring let look Arc Length let look sector area looking using academic language even thing grade level know personally teach geometry time lot kid get geometry still cant solve one step equation know dumbfounded happens sometimes geometry teacher cant stop everything hit everything theyre missing sometimes kind grinning weve got pick move forward think stem class opportunity pick material kid lost along way think teach stem class need incorporating solving equation even simple stuff whatever project student missing variable let say building something thats shape triangle may tell want two side length weve got figure third one use Pythagorean theorem thing like use trigonometry little way pick work EOC teacher think underutilized know lot time like Ive specifically reach Math teacher teacher stem class help guy dont think whenever Geometry classroom wasnt thinking ask anybody else could help kind feel like island alone think still teacher conversation think lot happy like said thats letter stem stand math kind stuff anyway know mass certified person wouldnt know start maybe conversation team teacher well know hey topic covering topic kid know dont way work stem class project kind mentioned earlier there lot project Teachers Pay Teachers stuff like look fun awesome meat doesnt get far need think stem great time project day lot kid stem class geometry took project seen Teachers Pay Teachers look like lot fun Ill honest dont think covered much needed class period know going take full day class close EOC testing couldnt didnt time wait today didnt think going worth reward instead take project stem class said project calculating different blood splatter there someone get murdered there blood splatter use trigonometry find angle happened shooter would kind thing Geometry didnt time background work needed done didnt time talk actual topic happening instead could covered material needed different avenue didnt take time away geometry another way think stem teacher need incorporated math whenever anything whenever build anything think need blueprint everything building way student getting active HandsOn measuring calculating value kind thing last one think weve seen standard change math know everythings kind moving towards heck think Geometry Ive got five six new standard based statistic know stem excellent place start getting background knowledge data collection student everything project wise collect data start analyzing start plotting data able read graph thing leniency stem Geometry cant spend two week talking really cool project semester doesnt lend Ive got building standard Ive got cover Ive got quickly partner stem stem class time incorporate really buy time well like said dont think done math think lot lot teacher using stem teacher stem underutilized matter far giving EOC teacher little assistance something trying Peabody High School Im hoping good effect think dont know Im talking Matthews well thought good thing add happen way math teacher responsibility incorporate stem teacher job incorporate math well yeah thats really anybody question also put question chat play waiting see anyone question chat mentioned didnt know teacher 28 teacher 15 school 6th District teaching subject grade youre hitting little bit everybody think thats really good see weve got broad range interest incorporate math system course also let everyone know said six district 15 school presentation towards want something grade level could take away Im also classroom teach stem class high school Im also geometry teacher first three year classroom taught geometry Peabody High School geometry teacher took year stem last year Im back geometry classroom year well teaching Honors group right Ill go tell right far feel pressure course coming removed classroom much Im still practicing lot stuff Im going talk today email well point question want access resource seems like intuitive incorporating math stem stem math harder think think good understand pressure felt understand asking anybody completely change theyre math know youve got work thing know important really believe dont say anything else hardly ever bring taught geometry three year fresh project Im level 5 math teacher thing really work Ill first one tell weve adapted new curriculum dont dont like okay feel like tie dont feel like thing seen make difference kid seen importance projectbased learning know scary cuz level 5 teacher still feel pressure new curriculum change Ive teaching fit promise stem classroom make difference test result speak know fear happens changing there kind reassurance give promise worth make project rigorous thing Im kind referring mentioned something lot presenter mentioned know dont try go child project try project incorporate dont reinvent wheel dont project time try incorporate time standard think thats really important dont dont need go say right

panicking oh gosh something didnt work first time think also need willing let kid take lead lot learned much student stem lab know maybe part idea behind let student get ownership learning see theyre learning topic subject let kid dive training well best resource sometimes little bit space youre sitting well lucky joined school going onetoone elementary similar story already gone one one middle school two dedicated computer lab wasnt much good teaching horribly backward way like embodiment everything onetoone allowed u stop two classroom called design studio Design Lab right Im sitting design lab 3D printer robot lot storage sewing machine live fabric Notions puff ball whatever there four shelf storage one race track Lego project stored puppet middle stored learn read mean Makerspace student keep stuff really important want able start project pick later Next Room design studio set green screen filming roll green screen there also 14 Raspberry Pi workstation setup think next year well increased probably 25 Raspberry Pi work station furniture Wheels two room 25 chair Im trying create much open floor space possible still using much room actively talk u little bit process youre going said two room youre process putting together Jen paused moment sorry phone call John tell u little bit process youre going room yeah kind thought term understand people question everyones trying figure even begin u started thinking term station space created idea mind kind group certain activity together kind like 3D like printing station 3D printer silhouette cameo cutter another station thats deconstruction station high school level kid take apart period electronic station David Saunders okay he he must drowning Sorrows somewhere sorry absolutely want bring Meredith Martin Meredith today thank much time thanks problem Im well enjoying blizzard Central New Jersey Im glad youre know North Jersey capital letter think got close like 16 18 inch deep almost lost baby

like Legos KNex know like construction station thing portable brought classroom bin know indoor recess stuff like wanted make sure Makerspace wasnt stuck room could space place kid could come also object Makerspace could taken brought classroom tried design thing modular way portable couple question coming chat room Eric asks show power result coming class mean show Sam play toy hey let check thing first need adjust mindset doesnt either thing Sam play toy good learning happening dont choose two board share way share make administration come watch much lab doesnt result graded activity thats thats one thing hate attaching great student different thing different level want administration see come kid collaborating theyre working together theyre learning successful working team partner think parrot something theyve learned back want see kid understanding theyre learning theyre learning want see Innovation student coming inquiry classroom many time go tangent well start project kid ask great conversation kid engaged learning asking question coming answer find administrator see come oftentimes less directing class sitting back resource student one directing lot learning Im help answer question kind Point right direction get stuck think say whole lot makerspaces stem powerful school student hey Meredith want make sure Im saying question right way Makerspace always stem lab necessarily think there much space Labs whatever heck want call mind HandsOn learning thats basically boil different level find general people talk stem little formalized tends lot highly focused curriculum still openended tends tie least district regular classroom student Makerspace general tend openended less curriculum exploring learning asking question collaborating Makerspace come going know want try something new today want go hand maybe find someone help question Ive project want theyre fluid type space never know one day next youre going find Makerspace said stem Labs tend little structured little formal opportunity crossover Ive seen school may room let say Makerspace know institutional leadership can not appropriately value awesome name existence happens occasion ingenious teacher fig people value awesome value stem come attached correct package Buzz word auspex stem create opportunity kind awesome happen meeting specific stem need think thats feel sometimes see Coincidence stem maker different party invested approach dot please create flexible learning space meet lot name Meredith Makerspace Guru New Jersey Ive seen pretty amazing thing 3D printer marshmallow toothpick mean Ive seen teacher convention turn 100 100 spaced amazing amazing thing Ive never seen pick puppet puppetry stem lab Makerspace sure think dont dont think think Makerspace people tend get focused technical end technology know bigger item Woodworking programming robotics makerspaces everything include sewing include craft include Paw Patrol kid express kid who comfortable speaking know facetoface teacher classmate maybe willing communicate puppet kind give little bit distance puppet talking create great movie commercial visual art using thing like puppet use puppet puppet like physical Avatar share movie still line District policy exactly okay Meredith answered question incorrectly Jennifer place stem education would like ask question role Makerspace know one hand talking creative know said walk blend creating food creating coming pretty hard fast lose Chihuahua snow little kind fun thats need stop live every single Sunday night teachercast TV

minute class know there kind opportunity reach learning goal assess use thing going Makerspace Makerspace may topic right question kind learning going value learning thats know kind attach know educational community office data getting worse instead data need studying people need connecting kid comforting answer administrator want know want know standard deviation last year score year score nice minute lab student dont great assess there huge difference assessing great student keep reflection Journal project started big design process project lab past week student keeping journal time theyre left spending least 5 10 minute end class jotting today accomplish team talk going feel weve done far going think something like way assess without giving specific grade able see kid task engaged learning questioning coming idea definitely accessible dont necessarily need great attached piggyback Sam said know many standard tie youre go say okay hitting particular standard even formal type lesson like would see stomach space stuff there much use type standard well chat Eric couple people asking talking Meredith thinking know let say cooperation teamwork ideation thing could decide

programming kid main focus creating program scratch controlled Makey Makey make make like marshmallow whipped cream cherry top coating Sunday theyve made one favorite word coding Makerspace Arduino spell well easy Arduino tiny little microcontroller allows attach programming thing like sensor light Motors one whole family microcontrollers trying begin microcontroller programming 5th grade want student able use stem class 6th 7th 8th grade Ive got task trying get kid learning use good news tinkercad curriculum called project ignite teach student use online 3D design software physical programming circuit building Arduino thats pretty cool here next one whats Tinker cat guy Scarecrow lion Dorothy wonderful Tinker cat online 3D design environment webbased know link Google account nicely go take tutorial little lesson learn design 3D quickly easily userfriendly Raspberry Pi anybody another family microcomputer period adult prototyping real thing real world going keep running show hockey puck done since guy captive creating stem lab let say hypothetically superintendent said go pick thing want look getting Chromebooks iPads Linux machine perfect device know word perfect hard one device wed rather mean looking kid told theyre Chromebook ready Im told Chromebook ready device mean think talking going get like 5000 tablet Amazon something think thing like stem education great vehicle school class Woodshop homak mode essentially creative expression student disguised vocational training weve gotten rid left super long block reading math stink oh bore student beyond anyone could reasonably expect even though teacher work really really hard come super engaging thing 24 kid time stem education kind refocus question kid thing think thats makerspaces flexible learning space variety there much thing run really well Chromebooks love Chromebooks use almost every day there also lot great software Hardware run PC thing tablet excel think youre able couple variety different type device going lot useful know single device single type device every student John think totally agree really depends green screen there wonderful green screen animation stuff like really something tablet better iPads particular great option like Chromebooks youre using Chromebook youre using web accessible tool mean kid go home use try whenever possible there thing like video editing audio editing tool require software download need PC agree need variety thing would really depend tool youre trying use make decision might first cant always variety thing budget send recently opened video like ask put show note get u link faced question upper said youre going building awesome awesome play lab one thing cant live without know Im talking robot duct tape know whats one thing know whats Cornerstone stem education long kid 4th grade glue gun anything glue gun youre going burn little hand got older 4th grade law burn child younger 4th grade apparently release parent sign Im serious one know would definitely make sure matter youre going use glue gun soldering iron people control job know ahead time youve researched local policy right work small Independence School 1 kid got burn pretty significantly thought coolest thing world parent okay seriously like know dont dont go saying gosh hope one get burned go saying child get burned burn ointment know tell child start using glue gun soldering iron treat burn immediately know like okay thats happens make puppet kid hardest thing figuring syllable Im going say Im trying express know find youre saying basically word third degree never good accident report bos doesnt know youre well never good period definitely want make sure bos knew POS theyre fairly inexpensive think try use thing lot different theyre onetrick pony two tool definitely fall one trick pony category ever needed use word first third degree accident report work independent school work public school would head platter union would walk away act like never heard name would use thing school dont think would would okay nice Meredith Im going Im going let end one wonderful picture great stuff youre teacher looking one resource go learn thing made obvious Im trying build step yet great resource go information please let get link oh gosh well tech teacher one pretty much everything find find useful go lot great stem Makerspace website excellent book world learning Laura Fleming put wonderful book getting started makerspaces Makerspace Manifesto there much stuff Make magazine amazing different project activity idea instructables website Ive recently gotten sucked instructablescom ton ton great project basically crowdsourced website student come direction instructables post instructables side well guy want say thank Im sorry Im sitting watching 3D printer go still really really need know talking know podcast inside Minecraft Ive never actually done podcast inside 3D printer kind need year guy want say thank much audience Channel TV absolutely amazing like stuff please dont let end show stop lot great resource Sams going collecting resource making sure theyre show note mean u Meredith thank much spending time u today feel completely schooled stuff one last time learn great thing happening area tech teacherscom thats everything go find one Twitter Kiki teach Twitter Jennifer going presenting anywhere soon find great thing youre Blog called teaching forward net Im Twitter Jenkins right Im local workshop dont dont think there anything next couple month term conference little quiet department fine know busy yesterday could tell u taking picture suffering sling Agony Jonas dont know youre referring four rainbow saw yesterday took three picture youre talking 3D printing talking rainbow everything okay cuz got pretend going die remember dont get two foot snow going die cool Cinema going finish next week going interesting education incredibly important give teacher opportunity student thing make thing figure thing class name learning well looking know Meredith IU havent talked lot way creating entire Makerspace entire School District 15 buck dollar store tell u little bit youve day know youve

Y9lGSRcIQ68,Im going talk concept microcontroller election know may seem like big deal going learning microcontroller wiggle couple port specifically couple bit port look organization course well really dont see much resistance kind ignore mean 33 volt equal 1000 equal 33 1000 equal 0003 33 milliamps 333333333333333 33 current flowing would cause led light hence say give 3 3 5 sound like top one thing add one top youll able turn led using part oh look put one might mean want light led put 0 mean might want like led let take look little bit detail implement basically concept lab number two get want make light 33 volt calculation board slide go least keep track let take let take look switch way give support number give port number hear let say switch let look two difference switch dont press switch look situation switch going LED like device going identify tied 0 0 0 5 way assuming Port 11 actually nothing consume resistance inside itll observe whats going point time current flow current situation there current flow whats voltage Port 11 pin whatever VCC right even though there resistor there current voltage VCC also side resistor soon press switch basically tie circuit go VCC resistor ground case wire directly tied ground directly go p100 resistor allow current flow VCC 0 0 resistor fact current going 33 milliamps 1000 ohm microcontroller read zero thats logical zero thats going use switch situation less alluded going use going use microcontroller port control LEDs read switch way reading switch youre going lab number three thought Id cover since talking concept microcontroller port going write cheat code think never pull group many taken 2103 currently taking ecgr 2103 right couple taken programming 213 currently 21203 erase hand right okay two got programming yeah okay everybody plus plus plus really easy plus plus dont worry Concepts object oriented language give let take look going youre going reading part 1 say look P1 meaning part 1 mean youre going read whatever connected Port one youre going stuff variable remember single equal sign assignment course see need set call end since port case 8 Bits result could data hold 0000000 1111 111111111 word there going many different combination 2 8th 260 256 switch connected situation youll 256 real combination could read go thats understand done class dont meet right oh want go little bit detail got people like let take one assignment number two mentioned going way go Moodle Specific Instructions less download software youve already done compiled put board General concept PC actually writing see laptop going use PC going develop software software develop going put call Target microcontroller USB facility cable there chip bored well youre going download another chip MSP 430 remember know address 30 right youll notice one chip board kind like middle little bit towards bottom sits actual controller microcontroller youre going using lady way bottom downloading board course youre going write code compile code download target run code target see Moodle due date make sure demo PC Ill demo right end class well actually show use tool use tool yet mean booting written code yet right Im going borrow somebody bored cuz didnt bring one Mane concept Simon number two youre going wiggling port two LEDs two LEDs LED one led 2 LED one connected Port one connected Port one bit six imagine kind picture actual board would look like youre going say oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh wanted light LEDs didnt see yet think think would write take second two turn neighbor trip prize closet mention prize closet think rest station right trip prize closet way tshirt idea size Im pretty sure extra large 400 figure C code youre going write well meet back couple second right raise hand want solve one right got price cant get get price yet okay Ill let ok Google volume equal 0100012 right thats wrong yes sir correct ding ding ding ding ding ding right decimal thats one nuance default default decimal binary Im getting board mixed cant remember 0 B everything else everything else followed B guess Id say probably like Ill check yes sir thats 65 yes would also work decimal value 65 would remember one would easier understand probably one world lot easier smaller compact designation often lot bite usually lot like total 4 byte together one time sometimes 800 youre looking larger number would say well sake class almost time hexadecimal good try good try still get price closet still get trip answer still get trip price closet oh thats right get new car get new car get new car Im sorry name opening around okay part 1 mentioned light wanted light LED one way right hand side would Port one equal hex 01 wanted light LED number two would say equal x 40 text 4060000 mean literally say turn turn previously previously turn stay turn question good question would say FF write turn everything going turning LEDs well two switch one lady LED number one actually turned LED number one number two number three would get point cuz want turn two three led number three going externally wired LED thats give experience using breadboard hooking another circuit thats lab number three wont worry one thing didnt tell Led number might get away LEDs LEDs output device right specifically say want make port pin part output device case two LEDs led number two weve said let see said Led one led wanted turn time want also declare theyre case going set 4 1 0 whole concept youre going give power power able light let go back electricity Basics well hold let first shown port bunch wire coming microcontroller many hey right hey Google organizing single bite 8 minute see later also turn turn saying P1 equal 41 turn P1 equal 0 hex want turn everybody understand Im giving basic microcontroller instruction assignment cool bean sure said certain amount time 1 half exactly 15 second really quick dirty cheesy way might work might Im sure case already know Loop instruction right everybody got previous sea yes dont know tell right 4 instruction equal 0 maybe 100000 incrementing one time going take certain amount time go instruction even nothing inside kind delay keep mind know difference integer long integer yes okay shorter long longer kind like using name self Define right regular integer us 16 bit value along 3225 15 could represent number 2 15th positive 2 15 1 thats range number whats range number 2 31st 2 31st positive 2 31 1 think minus one total 232 655 billion dollar turn two billion little bit 2 billion 2 billion positive 2 billion 4 billion different number youll need change value variable make sure make going two many think could right right one two maybe give right figure well note little bit older actually first group Ive everybody 2103 previous semester maybe half CC plus plus everybody understands CNC plus plus going make robot next message dog timer big concept dont even want go develop really really really really really complex embedded system need whats called watchdog timer remember direction already know right notice say operate forever think picture wireless know camera Etc never want stop running right youll always wild one line somewhere code mean go forever youre going light led p100 value youll delay oh say two second whatever youre going another one youre going another delay youre going start code give return 0 easy enough right could probably even demonstrate Thursday Wednesday office hour cant remember okay afternoon right right ask Tuesday Thursday keep mind shes going available 900 cuz test Thursday morning going make get bad grade test okay good period never know something like show exam project first start project start new project youre going give option instructed go ahead make sure choose MSP 430 G 25553 note lab number three see problem 0123456 7 remembering Computer World start counting 000 least significant bit significant bit calculation work decimal could work binary could work hex far easier actually see relate HEX recap identify want contain value 0001001 zero specific microcontroller youre going using need give project name recommend include space name Ill call lab demo call lab youre also going identifying doesnt give much choice empty project main dot see finish give code need get ready start lab kind PowerPoint slide given example look remember talked Watchdog timer give first line main program return zero literally put Good good bit right PowerPoint slide Ill give hint thats online general question right 25553 p 439 think lab number lab number 32 lab number two right thats thank much thats going equal hexadecimal value digit whats value 0001110 binary hack good one remember least able derive cuz youre going use lot may see quiz exam talked port port would would call one going lot stuff port going stuff P2 end 5 week Port one 8 Bits 0123456 7 8 Bits theyre going hooked bit Hardware device Hardware use connect switch LEDs switch serve input LEDs output something like switch Im sorry LED well let take look two way connect imagine microcontroller wire coming microcontroller representing one bit one port let say one thats designation often give connected followed LED thats tied ground remember electricity give port 0 volt thats 0 volt many volt change voltage potential OK Google excite device inside LED light give 33 volt pretty typical microcontroller right 33 value know Im going 33 let say 1000 Ohm resistor itll go change voltage right mean current flow question much know much remember physic,2

wy2iLgERLkE,today class start new topic microcontroller architecture particularly look perspective interfacing sensor actuator like different kind microcontroller need know choose appropriate one application looking okay Im assuming class already exposure microcontroller programming kind idea time 1 read kind block diagram okay thing microcontroller inside micrometer case 885 microprocessor Ford chip typically internal register array okay 8 number indicated b c Samsung 8717 855 see know external interface see 885 okay thats microprocessor microcontroller saw definition okay like read thing talked last time kind thing make sense know instruction going continue dont know structure play architecture make sense command Okay diagram given Im giving explanation command move BC difficult kind see going happen system okay architecture diagram quite important many microcontroller system typically magnificent weather reason operation 0 okay used like looping operation say example variable decremented let know become 0 flag automatically set like one read flag register like take control loop like okay need exit loop like base level happens microwave used many execution depend upon kind flag register black register play important role micrometer mean may able see part architecture may show modern microcontroller diagram animated like many different kind thing read make sense okay happens like okay see much operational control instruction give detail like know instruction microphone color typically giving detail refer say okay flag register receipt bit flag set like nothing changed something like part command instruction detail okay let continue 8854 Okay functionality register interested really need understand thing programming perspective make use information given part architecture concerned really interested microcontroller designed working inside interested knowing working inside lot detail architecture register level need known kind really figure okay going get detail know intention class okay intention kind like problem figure okay program two kind achieve want achieve okay like looking holiday generally know limit stretched OK Google kind conclusion drawn easily bye bye bye looking architectural program data sheet xcp 100 example several interface module enhance functionality digital iOS pwms period thing go well beat idea kind get like advanced version microcontrollers one Diva board Armco text M4 series microcontroller board take programming class okay well get experimental understanding based syntax okay couple class Ill post board maybe run Resort shoe might facing microcontrollers class know used kind mechatronics application okay another glass microphone microprocessor used mobile platform okay mobile display application okay example specifically needed kind application start writing assembly level command programming like programming see rather simply level compiler okay typically like know environment development environment integrated development environment okay environment recipe case software environment convert language actually carry operational execute okay thing done user doesnt need know option like know send language command used exhibiting program need write program writing C like know job done well get programming aspect pretty soon hold important know efficacy using converted court Kodak microcontroller understand execute easily okay Im saying thing done many different way okay thing would turn situation come probably like time change logic using NC simpler kind logic youre using kind know complex logic change simple logic try see many time like unique straightforward answer thing OK Google 6300 microcontroller yeah memory block written like know flash memory know lot different kind memory written voltage regulator kind penis Peninsula one read data sheet claim get understand like thing one see register okay exchange outside 80 electricity conversion like fine Siri pwm interface synchronous serial interface interface also kind different different kind interface sexy scan example control area network interface like Serial communication protocol like short distance kind communication developed like provided exit 300 kind microphone player okay example want say OK Google say 20 comma sensor interface answer question think okay 20 sens want produce possible 6316 Channel 1182 converter seems although like given technology different see number 1620 channel 16 Channelside okay journey going next couple picture okay let begin need detail architecture different level architecture usually like know detail given architectural diagram interface important know programming perspective okay talk programming like deal little detail okay let move another picture example want find function different kind package okay low profile package know package like know ship packaged know thing 10 minute coming cute need see intention appropriate kind package microcontroller okay little bit 6500 see looking information 6300 moving next impossible see data sheet XP 100 enough want whatever strategy philosophy using information need understand okay thats know want background microcontroller domain name ok Google know look okay look OK Google experience would valuable understand part like part understood completely like know need something get able kind like understanding lot thing immediately clear okay practice go kind 885 course simple block diagram go understand OK Google need set register get meaningful operation done command look look register detail microcontroller okay know dont stop OK Google play speech need open Facebook current address okay look apparent thing appropriate okay let know name given listener General Motors need look name look like know digital input course like appropriately look particular interface know go detail opened way see okay put Im searching kind thing may happen like see entire country code name need look might happening like philosophy lot information given term microcontroller can not given term kind block diagram like American General understanding okay ability kind get see program figure okay mean u look kind data sheet microcontroller exercise firmly philosophy mostly multiple across multiple platform look thing want okay opportunity kind like already whatever well opportunity go little detail actually program kind series shut one best 8085 microcontroller microprocessor actually like mean basic computer chip begin 586 kind thing let know go back history let see one first computer developed know still like know good academic kind understanding really really see based architecture block diagram okay Ill post data sheet like 8085 like know Modern kind microcontrollers contact okay kind compare data sheet see like kind try make sense thing part thing try go important aspect example play microprocessor kind make microcontroller basic difference make like like hardware interface exchange data really microcontroller okay difference word used microprocessor us microcontroller microprocessor like New York premium chip kind computer chip actually interfaced external chip talk hardware store terminal actually okay microprocessor processing part chip control Parts interface device architecture 885 system know typically given kind form okay like base level

Ia1QXHPfKJw,Amsterdam everyone talk teaching sensor new trick machine learning going super interesting webinar 25 minute presentation bit recent development Silicon industry well talk bit computer enables little hint something new trick actually dive kind workshop portion webinar computer using board actually trained two different model Ill give big something thats able board got 336 got 335 data know happening cost bandwidth power constraint least misleading signal also throw away lot really valuable data lot valuable conclusion draw data longer compression rate Feels Like device intelligence really way move higher value use case case device rather sending ear compressed version compressed representation sensor data rather say okay well Ive heard vibration pattern might lead full state week since historical data might temperature vary way Ive never seen temperature gone turn 25 thats alarm required alright Ill look historical data see know something look like something weve seen recover even comparing machine factory like machine different machine Factory interesting information power band constraint lot less place say well single bite temperature way never seen actually might much better battery life instead send every hour thats kind resolution need idea many sensor fact device sending message already indication something interesting going would much valuable device sends signal something going maybe thing every day ensure device still alive rather burn Cycles every hour send couple feature dont really give value right want ideal world get might guessed based title webinar there one technology thats really great finding kind pattern really messy data thats machine learning machine pretty white used outside Internet thing kind every place large data Lake dated kind unstructured format wait try find hidden pattern data anything human come really reasonable Excel thats apply machine want start field think lot people call machine learning associated large cluster server figured u machine learning u problem device either power bank constraint two world machine learning lot cluster full gpus world embedded iot device constrained dont seem able connect fortunately couple year ago new movie time Neil 10 actress company acquired armed kind going quest within Google find new interesting technology started talking team OK Google Keyword recognition Android phone realized seemed actually build always Spotify figured run wakeboard detection responds OK Google wake application process arrest something actually hit power constraint still delivering really good user user experience OK Google team actually managed get whole wake word model working billion Android phone 20K Ram something really amazed time Neil tan kind came conclusion might seem realize well disregard training phase moment try find machine learning model thats going fit raw data find conclusion rather focus inferencing train model run really small tiny device make small possible run actually really underpowered day controller way think like kind first slide said thats industrial device showed capable running 20 million operation per second kind typical cortex Mike controller day controller really great running mathematical function specially simple one machine learning model essence mathematical function parameter training finding parameter finetuning best approach nation data set heavy process afterwards mathematical function yeah might maybe 100000 operation function might need execute result thats lot faster training phase something actually optimize run really small controller dsps first first idea done bunch new optimization one new thing kind discovered 2 year back trade accuracy speed win lot speed lose tiny bit accuracy done contestation neural network typically mathematical function typically operates four bite floating Point Unit floating Point number required youre machine learning model lot parameter want able really find tune parameter well youre right asked actually swap 8 win lot speed fixed Point math much smaller number second realized reduce parameter parameter mathematical function actually dont contribute much result prune network last week spot weve done Matrix multiplication device many many decade leverage swap Vector multiplication within neural network something run example people go lot lot faster together year really get machine learning model small enough run battery really good anything messy high resolution center data stuff like recognizing sound something really really hard want program kind easy say hear sound 100 decibel okay wake might controller lot harder write code say well someone say yes wake mind control machine learning really good find boundary similar bio signal analysis day get kind already messy like PPG sensor something thats finger wrist Smartwatch might use detect heart rate get lost really interesting information example Sleep Station covid onset detection abnormal vibration pattern well really easy write code say well see vibration higher 18 meter per second per second wake something there app normal prior designing mobile phone also connected device different Power class yeah Im today want abnormal motivation pattern get away riding lot threshold value might much easier might find much better threshold bit machine also enables mention new use case kind interesting one fusion place kind one machine learning model multiple sensor contributing model day want want know temperature room buy temperature sensor relatively easy detect there also stuff really hard detect single sensor like door kitchen whole way open maybe barometric pressure sensor something kind feel wind flowing maybe temperature sensor detect little bit drop light sensor see there light room door open maybe together actually find find machine learning model detect super interesting new field weve done lot really great optimization wider ecosystem guy computer also also figured okay well let actually build silicon really optimized kind stuff asked back little bit ECM 3532 usually start computer fixed voltage internally consume lot power whatever activity case remove voltage overconsumption square voltage acceleration machine used many type machine learning application value mean really run machine learning bachelor party device going use today AI sensible receive 4532 nice restaurant 215 memory everything program directly connected smallest person USB u delivered box see show easy program gym first want also Gtech connector connect San Francisco want build new model raw data let see set flash II sensor Data Logger application capture highly highly highly recommend anything machine learning capture data first capture data still surprising even talk company data kind Lifeline predictive maintenance company asked could give 30 minute high resolution maybe device typically grab data 1000 hertz give 30 minute high resolution healthy machine sensor data often even case think like everything start today always expect feature raw data cant extract raw data feature AI sensor build data collection client accelerometer easy write code get data sensor like machine learning replacement weve last 30 year industry around device intelligence first time actually look sensor data draw conclusion called signal processing past still relevant like raw data coming notoriously hard deal messy u kind first step always think data look good signal processing Pipeline first even go something machine learning already tell u data separate well something wrong data example signal processing pipeline could well Im taking role audio signal going 32000 Features 16 kilowatt time 16 compressed 2 4 0 9 5 Green Machine learning extreme agent place usually use small amount want like little side step photo 3 year ago first time really got connection iot machine learning got together one teaching summer school Arusha Tanzania day Africa teaching mathematics computer science master PhD student meant actually data collection model train student often way machine learning get data set started experimenting data set try see get accuracy kind leaf could really either one three make bit guess thats going really hard else fast transfer data look first height peak X Z axis three feature going lot lot easier u also way

room actually biggest source contaminant imagine know dust clothes hair even skin cell accidentally fall get onto device youre making making tiny could potentially ruin device instead dress bunny suit basically protecting device second thing must done clean room highly filter air remove Dust emphasize exactly clean clean room like invite Aaron onto stage demonstration thank much clean clean room see number back see class 100 clean room 100 Coles per cubic foot really really really really science engineering working metric imagine cubic square foot imagine 100 equal thats hard see hand auditorium million particle per cubic foot mean really hard u imagine 100 party particle 05 micrometer know stick 100 together get hair think theyre like ridiculously tiny theyre big enough cause problem Ive got student somebody suit help u understand going start Ciara coming auditorium marshmallow represent particle tiny itty bitty mini marshmallow marshmallow like big good thank Joanna wonderful introduction Johanna pointed going talking today building device go brain talk listen brain might wondering field right dont necessarily like brain class school right biology maybe engineering architecture class youre college particular field called bioengineering bioengineering kind exactly sound like building tool let u better understand test biological phenomenon work bioengineering type scientist researcher could think Engineers every sort physicist biologist computational turn giant one like skin cell like flaking shes thoroughly covered dont give little bit shake yeah there much take look pretty darn dirty really messed everything clean clean room comparison 10000 marshmallow couldnt fit million come Misha look like perfectly clean shirt anything right one marshmallow go class 100 thank much fabricate device wanted show actual device weve made device designed interface rat brain might wondering rat Ive talking human entire time well reason technology design brand new never tested might imagine first time make one wouldnt want go ahead implanted grandma brain brother sister brain right instead use model organism see characterize study device perform also learn rat frame performs use information better understand hopefully translate human use future picture left show device rat brain shaped connector top clamp connect electronics entire device 6 cm long think length one finger example bottom see blue box blue box there four different spike coming thats actually part interface rat brain zoom see there picture right Shanks actually 100 micro meter wide widest point talked width hair one Shanks actually width one hair really really tiny see device there bunch black spot black dot actually individual electrode designed pick neural interface signaling rat brain next Im going play sound want think might listening play right youve time really think actually listening rat brain video first Im going walk youre looking play better understand whats going graph left White House assign individual electrode number one 45 xaxis measuring time way think row every time one electrode pick spike nearby neuron going make little different color Poshmark picture right actually rat moving maze birdseye view put little bit cartoon rat kind see little bit hard see actual image he pointing tail pointing maybe see tail green circle head implant want look play video move maze there going bunch little tiny colored dot follow path dot change color actually mean device picking different area brain firing mean actually see brain work figure want get next tree Im going play video combined sound see work saying around see design many different shape size depending need example want interface central nervous system make device go brain cartoon little curly cue device see left make device go surface brain yellow pad whats nice theyre made polymer theyre nice flexible go fold brain get really nice contact interface neuron hand want study peripheral nervous system say want look particular nerve sky arm two separate thing left device thats going nerve bundle study whats happening nerve want see nerve performs whole actually wrap device around entire bundle Ive shown bunch interesting technology term make device make electrical recording might wondering well whats next go Im going bring Anna onto stage talk cool new technology working thank Allison talk make neural interface talked listen electrical signal neural interface right whats next brain lot electrical signal right there brain cell even there type cell there sort thing going youre listening electrical signal youre missing lot thing going brain fact still communicate electrical signal though also communicates chemical signal way sell body something want say transmits electrically axon happens actually hears whats chemical released chemical called neurotransmitter neurotransmitter actually go one cell next transmit message resume transmission actually happens place called synapse two cell nearly touch 100 Nan meter size going back hair 100 micron 100 nanometer thousand time smaller small area transfer happening still going try hear whats going zoom look neurotransmitter pink dot make even bigger know even there really pink dot write neurotransmitter chemical theyre molecule often molecule bunch different type chemical molecule neurotransmitter released time could represent chemical formula could represent different color Saturday raining guy still came anyways going use Lucky Charms remember tie back specific neurotransmitter listen way kind interface electrical signal listen build sensor thing chemically chemical sensor surface specifically designed interact case one lucky charm fish lucky charm interact surface fish come contact surface creates change change represented green arrow change transduced electrical signal nicely read computer transduction like translation imagine taking physical change translating electrical signal whole idea isnt something new anyone know somebody diabetes probably check blood glucose pretty regularly went Texas Im Texas went high school Central Texas really like science thought maybe want doctor lot time youre taking science class learn know doctor science went college kind undecided didnt know wanted got scholarship become chemist major chemistry became chemist made sense good choice liked ever since continue path chemistry kind gotten back medical side thing engineering background music chemical engineering actually high school idea wanted applying Colleges actually applied everywhere Undeclared didnt know realtime feedback sort Technology making much much smaller trying make last longer give continuous readout instead something stick machine get one recording Allison showed device go rat right electrical recording similar device electrical chemical recording top human hair reminder left device there two kind white connector plug actually get information device thats part kind connect get information right part circled actually part device go brain purplish blue electrode sensor look electrical signal right larger circle 50 micron diameter theyre made platinum going actually build chemical sensor glutamate want see glutamate glutamate there 10 G body thats lot well much significant portion body made glutamate glutamate kind ubiquitous monosodium glutamate food seasoning come lot dot dont worry really good meal going change brain chemistry see next slide ton body glutamate thats actually brain amount level regulation glutamate correct brain get learning memory movement way want lot thing take granted way go everyday life glutamate like average Optimal level dont enough glutamate reason get sort different problem anything brain development know nobody want different issue communication memory insomnia associated low glutamate much glutamate also lot problem come like also learning disease learning disability timer disease autism even there high level actually start brain cell die building center Im going showing top reminder nice look like center going crosssection one silver circle youre seeing top one electrode turn sideways going look crosssection build top device bottom youre seeing kind read read sensor apply voltage bias electronic thats kind kind bias might think magnet attracting electron apply bias molecule area neurotransmitter donate electron back forth surface create current change youre seeing little hump happens know binding event occurs goal next slide going try detect Lucky Charms hat going first worst case scenario right work basically dont get kind signal Lucky Charms hat lot molecule Lucky Charms brain fact create signal dirty surface think youve ever seen medical device youve ever seen anything go even like mud right thats probably relevant today go outside step mud stay shoe lot molecule thing brain also dirty theyll cover surface wont able sense glutamate add selective filter top think like sponge different sized hole wont let lot different Lucky Charms particular filter designed fact Let lucky charm fish small cuz swim whatever want use analogy Lucky Charms fish fact move selectively membrane add another layer bit suspended enzyme enzyme actually specifically interact react Lucky Charms hat digest create product fish fish swim surface create signal indirectly detect case Lucky Charms hat reaction happens specifically region use indirect detection lot different molecule Vivo imagine change enzyme start look different molecule told work guy probably know science cant say something work science lab experiment prove want show test thats show theyre actually working middle screen youre saying tip device turned cartoon youre seeing far right tip device electrode put beaker standard Beaker there nothing special one youve probably used chemistry science lab add injection neurotransmitter want look testing see itll respond glutamate injection glutamate well look change signal well also injection thing make sure seeing signal glutamate Im going leave cross section left remind guy kind whats going right device City buffer solution chemical see signal see flat green line expect injection see rapid increase current thats want show seeing change current response glutamate continue injection injection see increase current trying see also want make sure detecting Lucky Charms case one Lucky Charms going Scorpio acid Vitamin C everywhere brain important dont want sensor detect injection right dont see change signal hoping sign sensor selective also want make sure cant see heart case dopamine dopamine guy probably heard another really important neurotransmitter want sensor see injection dont see increase dont want see neurotransmitter might also region take glutamate increase saw known concentration youre seeing left actually turn standard calibration curve youre seeing right weve done take concentration glutamate know injection amount put xaxis yaxis current corresponding step left Axis left sorry plot thing let u know take device plant brain see current change much glutamate actually associated current change seeing body back device look like going take tip device going actually take implant deep brain rodent implanted animal move around amazing thing like actually use dental cement fix rest device animal head thats look like crosssection left thats look like animal head right implanted day later animal moving around super happy start teach different behavior youre seeing pink signal glutamate sensor youre seeing bottom signal kind controller goal line stay flat see change sensor would indication know first year college actually friend kind take one introduction engineering class decided sit know

oval electrode black arrow designate electrode want sensing site 50 away electrode wanted control site see dark blob sensing site thats actually kite enzyme layer able successfully deposit see lot even really interfering control site took device wanted characterize wanted measure sensitivity glutamate bar graph comparing electric chemical method hand painting method white axis show sensitivity device glutamate whats even great technique 13 time sensitive handpainted technique mean higher Sensitivity measure even smaller change glutamate brain great really encouraged result wanted go ahead look lifetime frame reference Im going go back electrical sensor talked implantation weve neuroscientist able use device 160 day brain looking electrical signal thats five month youre really able get understanding brain change long term however testing last 14 day implantation know great wanted see form another hypothesis beyond looking device looked outside wanted look brain environment specifically particular case wanted see specific chemical brain also causing enzyme layer degrade faster rate took three different device coded enzyme put three different soaking Solutions vial left device soaking phosphate buffered saline PBS salt Solution thats pH brain considered control test there chemical mixed violin middle show PBS mixed glutamate vial right show PBS mixed score big acid narrowed brain really complex environment wanted see glutamate orbic acid play role affecting enzyme lifetime wanted quantify able measure life time order actually ran calibration curve similar Anna mentioned growing putting device studying outside body better understand work body there silico system computational model help u understand either large amount data human animal help u model different organ different system might work computationally come next three talk science Saturday think youll get see xvo Vivo system example well talking brain today brain part nervous system nervous system consists two different part there central nervous system brain spinal cord there also peripheral nervous system nerve running throughout body rapidly transmit signal youve seen similar graph graph left showing actual data collect calibration curve measurement measuring current yaxis function time xaxis graph right starting map different change glutamate test speaker current play role put one injection glutamate see stepwise increase current map calibration curve right injection glutamate see start starting build calibration curve right getting orange dot end experiment may able kind see slope kind draw line try line showing dot make sloped right measure slope quantitative way see enzyme layer degrading time example say device soaking solution test one week seeing result week zero week one blue dot already start see soaking one week solution slope starting get little bit flattered right soaking two week seen yellow triangle right getting even flat like three green triangle flat finally week four purple diamond essentially slope completely flat horizontal line mean matter much glutamate Im injecting test speaker Im seeing change current chemical sensor longer working go ahead run kind calibration curve silk Solutions compare axis percent drop sensitivity want emphasize drop mean larger bar worst device performed device soaking PBS see 15 drop sensitivity device soaking glutamate Orbach acid showed least 50 drop sensitivity able conclude presence chemical brain also contributing lower enzyme lifetime looking forward future Anna hope design think kind shield could protect enzyme layer way increase chemical sensor lifetime wrap talk demonstrated make neural interface microfabrication also talked use inter measure electrical chemical signal might wondering whats next answer actually dont know know term 20 30 year future field Broad there many unknown question hoping stuff might inspired think question might want answer brain help u fill question mark like thank much time back spinal cord brain back central nervous system system let touch really hot item like stove rapidly pull hand back right instead waiting signal burn hand quickly rapidly pull back thanks system go back brain brain giant well really giant pound organ right Big Mac solid actually made lot individual cell cell called brain cell theyre small actually zoom single brain cell youre seeing left cell body cell body 10 micron large give idea 10 micron one hair go ahead grab right feel pretty small right thats 10 cell body back back width hair sell body lot call dendrite coming dendrite kind reach anthropomorphize cell listen signal cell there also axon axon long extended body reach axon terminal cell us talk others guy familiar tin phone yeah idea person talk one side tin phone string transmit message 10 phone person waiting message exactly axon work cell sort way transmit message us electricity transmit signal axon heard neighboring cell continue pas message building interface kind listen add additional electrical signal whats going brain idea neural interface brain machine interface isnt probably new thing Hollywood thanks science fiction idea interface could possibility something know bet guy better idea actually make open Forum could actually interfacing directly cell quite Holly would right term device one thing though Im showing behind behind whats called cochlear implant one state art neural implant exist right youre seeing around Womans ear bunch electronics microphone way might right microphone pick whats said room transmitted transmits electronics instead little microphone pack little Electronics behind ear instead going speaker guy hear microphone sends information transmitter transmitter gray Circle youre seeing kind back head transmitting signal another piece instrumentation thats actually inside head thats really cool part cant see directly interfacing auditory nerve sends electrical impulse auditory nerve basically nerve learns use sound way people artificially,2
N8XdchwemrU,okay Im talk today pilot work Ive done Early Childhood playground using speech location wearable sensor funding work came University Kentucky Early Childhood research development initiative Kansas intellectual developmental disability Research Center main collaborator work Beth Rouse Ying Lau Justin Lang Joanne Rejoice Haley burst storm Christopher Cushing also assisted planning planning implementation project today Ill discussing preliminary preliminary result work similar play Poe switch Educators told go typical day child Lena opinion tag assured see child

observer novel approach provides mean capture information could used potentially positively impact childrens longterm outcome well informed design playground contact order support interaction child peer adult peer adult thanks Im going hand Daniel welcome everybody Symposium using sensing Technologies classroom experience development Ill talking interactive behavior school name Daniel messenger University Miami interactive behavior school Ibis wearing Tech bright talking folk coinvestigators Ill introducing top one guess one basically Dwight done great introduction movie Signs Melina use test youre seeing kid moving around classroom thats want talk harness objective measure understand kid interacting theyre developing mostly inclusion classroom community really trying objective call objective data data data acquisition measurement using device here little guy best best use best rather insurance Lena recorder two sentenced recorder well use get orientation way kid face okay minding business story happened Monday business Rudolph left say know check cool device typically developing kindergartener see bouncing around red guy girl blue guy boy send mixing top left blue boy three blue boy one girl needed help make called Charming song right slide Charming professor physic University Miami said yeah way analyze kind data better understand child actually Social contact maybe work like maybe guy close enough given everybody might whole course observation say theyre Social contact guy sure Ill talk applied three observation kind validated play childhood classroom time spent playground early childhood setting provides opportunity young child interact adult peer interaction result improvement language social emotional motor development well physical activity child special need may experience limited opportunity ageappropriate interaction peer playground missed opportunity could slow email address Developmental challenge also know theyre contextual factor influence playground shape climbing Dome compared Roller Slide showing kind homophily respect gender know degree classroom moved ongoing collaboration Debbies school University Miami one program one picture saw think third slide Debbie School Debbie Institute one program program kid hearing loss kid kid hearing loss theyre filled mean theyre vocalizing one another synchronizing location movie set audio here distribution function remember kid moving around imagine potential possible distance kid chance two kid really close within area thats youd expect channel trying figure whether child really Social contact also said well Social contact kind closeness wise distance wise also facing within 45 degree hearing loss classroom message particularly Salient kid let look time one child talk one classmate one observation like first time 7 10 observation like weekly interval sometimes theyre longer turn doesnt really matter child speaks child much one observation shall speaks child theyre Social contact observation see got pretty nice something there school pattern much talked peer predicts much pure talk kind dyadic process running classroom moreover kind divided Id like say semester really first half observation second much speaks first half observation let say several month predicts much speaks second half observation turn mediates predicts expressive language ability kid use PLS five end year kind cool interactive predicting language ability next speech signal wasnt interested Social contact well forget social contact till till next project key complexity take way tell u something complexity child speech number speech sound English present organization average find adult really associated observation number complexity association one thing exactly Association Association look like taking mean child complexity vocalization predicts language ability moved class contained inclusion class class far inclusion classroom except first typically developing kindergarten guy wrong preschooler like 3 500 minute hang Social contact asking kind kid approach see respect ASD today think hope always agree adult hanging might teacher might observer know making activity log class look top part graph issue see typically developing kid bottom likely approach approach typically developing child velocity child ASD approach child seeing police preschool classroom eligibility basically seeing child contextual factor influence interaction child playground way assess interaction typically direct observational tool common approach 112 azarak p capture physical activity level social grouping type activity child another tool pope measure appear engagement outdoor natural environment child initiation parallel play engagement game drawback approach require intensive training robot reliability check category know perhaps wed like see thats use objective measurement see fact going pulling vocalization Regina Fasano one Lynn Perry student Ibis project shes looking make social network kid Social contact remember theyre speaking could able constitute frequency vocalization social contact network cool use characterize entire classroom thats really idea think objective measurement see see everything autism ASD within group modularity look blue kid network speak less kid kid ASD youd expect given kind way speech distributed throughout classroom really play observation Lorde classroom resource language classroom really see looking number individual connection child comprises measure degree centrality thank still vocalization social contact one peer level reciprocal vocalization predicts childrens taking forward future direction area think important one machine learning make assumption moving around let take look kid first course always take look much kid vocalized last several minute much peer vocalized last several minute thats coming building vocalization let use use deep neural network predict much child going vocalize next minute see pretty good job ability predict much child observation Spotify best predict much child speak know amount child speech potent predictor language ability maybe also language development Ibis size see iris wearing little vest got little bit objective measurement scalable inclusion classroom currently really use look classroom structure create network kid interacting maybe throw teacher give u window dyadic relationship much speaks predicts much B speaks course guessed going take weekly monthly observation fundamentally trying get text get sense interactive contribution language development child interaction classroom peer teacher facilitate growth kid lot thing take village case take two lab group lab group Bens lab group take IES funders include Spencer Foundation Tiffany talk project next resource autism Science Foundation National Science Foundation currently funded nidcd look classroom child hearing loss Id love talk collaboration project thank Daniel name Tiffany Foster Ohio State University today Ill discussing ongoing project focus using sensing Technologies understand longitudinal pure social network early language Development begin know preschool year time Rapid language development driven top child exposed interaction others childdirected talk found particularly important acquisition language skill increasing number child spending large portion Early Childhood preschool classroom attention placed understanding interaction child experience preschool classroom contribute language development importantly preschool year child spend large portion time interacting peer estimate child spend half day due large quantity time young child spend interacting tear researcher started consider role interaction may childrens language development Fairfax literature study tend find child classroom peer higher language skill average tend show greater language grow recent study also found Fairfax operate independently teacher effect Pierce may impact greater influence childrens language growth teacher preschool year limitation church mechanism appears influence language development thoroughly explored one study 10 inch address limitation found language skill peer child frequently greatest influence language development word child interacts matter social network approach help researcher understand relationship two child interact language development social network analysis link tie among child classroom examined figure right slide show example visualization pure social network dot represent child link represent social connection child indicated solid Green Dot would considered large social network comprised peer circle child indicated arrow would considered small parasocial Network child position within network thought direct influence child play focused one child adult time another difficulty arises trying get place playground interaction happening may somewhat difficult getting slide without see whats going child without interrupting there advance sensing tool taking place would say maybe past six seven year tool capture real time behavior typical activity contact without need observer work Ive done looked using speech location capture classroom adult talk also look Playmates interaction princess constraint opportunity created network turn influence development concerning language development specifically individual difference peer interaction pattern likely shape language development peer language Network used understand language skill among child classroom child interact frequently peer stronger language skill like accelerated language development child interact peer lower language skill child isolated peer mentioned child isolated classroom social network meaning access fewer language resource well connected child research highlight importance child direct talk supporting language development child may display slower language development compared peer understanding child position within classroom Network shape language development important implication educational practice teacher May adopt classroom help language resource flow successfully Ill briefly discus method used study social network preschool classroom traditionally researcher relied Direct observation gold standard understanding childrens experience classroom approach may involve collecting coding video audio recording conducting inperson observation however observation multiple limitation theyre often impractical costly term time observation also biased observer personal perspective belief leading potential difficulty accurately representing social experience diverse group child observation also difficulty accurately representing childrens complex social interaction language development often influenced Dynamic bleeding interaction provide input Childrens developing language system arent always captured observation furthermore personal observation typically one child observed time short portion school day leading loss understanding interaction simultaneously occurring within classroom weve discussing alternative traditional observation sensing Technologies tool embedded classroom collect analyze data multiple student simultaneously weve seen session two common sensing Technologies location tracking device audio recorder used combination speech processing algorithm code recording information related quality quantity speech speaker produce exposed benefit sensing Technologies include ability capture continuous potentially realtime information individual dynamic classroom experience interaction sensing Technologies also help researcher collect objective data experience diverse group student necessary different influence language development different child recent study employing sensing Technologies support importance reaching accurate understanding childrens individualized dynamic classroom experience using information multiple childrens location orientation towards one another researcher created estimate social contact among peer generated classroom social network another study 680 hour recorded audio file one classroom used illustrate quantity childrens talk peer time related growth language skill research focused refining Technologies use classroom example algorithm developed separate speech background noise important noisy classroom environment software train using child speech also improving accuracy speech quality quantity information extracted recording discus ongoing study peer language network preschool classroom thats employing use sensing Technologies study focus objective continuous measurement childrens social linguistic interaction peer preschool classroom multiple time course year order reflect changing dynamic interaction within classroom Network overarching goal study precisely represent individual difference preschooler linguistic experience identifying Salient predictor individual experience specifically plan focus identifying social interaction thing influential preschooler language development need test hypothesis talk among child drive language development significant individual

Technologies also potential help researcher collect objective data reach better understanding language development diverse group child whose social experience classroom vary widely view childrens spontaneous language within classroom context strong positive input childrens development spontaneous language captured using something Technologies reveal strength child evident decontextualized task may biased child minoritized background also acknowledge importance relying exclusively use sensing Technologies reduce bias research something consider move forward work concludes presentation thank attention thank investigator project question session contact move live QA portion session thank joining u question answer part panel Im Laura Justice going serve moderator encouraging jump ask question work shared via chat question Sarah Serene question language environment dual language Learners Early Education setting Im curious Dwight Tiffany Daniel work look duel language Learner classroom environment interaction others language exposure one dissertation paper wasnt using sensing technology classroom look child dll status moderator found evidence instance dll child appear benefit exposure peer higher language skill term English language development specifically looking peer English language skill Daniel think going jump sound like interesting result interesting tapestry language guess quite interested investigating effect dont answer yet Im even sure best phrase question yet would nice could distinguish distinguished language childrens individual recorder automatically knew whether hearing example Spanish English speaking Spanish English work problem Im wondering young kid bilingual education setting child maybe model Spanish Im curious technology far technology term contending multilingual environment instance Daniel Dwight youre using Lena recording device new idea system language General capture say exposure complex language differentiate across language recorder later submit whatever software picture movement cant capture movement location multiple child adult space multiple time per second easy objective approach there there human Observer estimate come tag within foot pretty accurate research question two much time Children spend different area playground slash near fixed equipment much talk place different area playground Lena language agnostic shouldnt really care language question raised folk introduced new technology go name Alice think kind dramatic Scandinavian language question adult speech technology like example Google distinguish language spoken dont know dont know reliability know noisy classroom environment workshop really interesting question dont know folk done work yeah would talk speech processing colleague think ask whether possible mean know theyve done looked multiple language see accuracy term know algorithm process speech whether distinguishes language seems possible think read Alice anybody want shoot email like technology processing language language discussed presentation recall question wanted put Katie Zimmerman asked expanding technological system requirement think Tiffany new collaboration across three research group said OU Dwight Kansas talk little bit technology actually using using microphone right Danielle kid dont think theyre terribly expensive Beacon set room track movement recorder capture kid voice well incoming talk others pipeline process talk one talk well incoming talk long processing system get output thing like much child spoken thing like lexical diversity incoming talk even outgoing talk there manual work whatsoever manual know youre getting mean sort way work sit whole manual element completely gone totally automatized manual work calibrate validate system Daniel Dwight Tiffany want add anything specific mean goal different choice make term sensor like really two three hundred buck fact technically Superior example Sony recorder think 100 buck future project choice respect youre going attract childrens movement one choice ubisofts ultrawide radio frequency identification thats cool tell everybody time real kind space cost lot economical solution Bluetooth Gators automated data collection Mike Dwight Im really interested perhaps expanding work youve done playground Behavior Support period yeah think one exciting thing sensing equipment allow u look mediated intervention playground classroom see kid interacting previously continuously across multiple day across multiple peer simultaneous manner havent done look kind evaluation intervention really point descriptive term trying get kid interaction within space specific feature space whether thats pretend play know playground slide kind thing think potential seem like know particularly equipment currently using scalable start think setting sensor dont know classroom able provide teacher feedback level interaction child well guess perimeter engine basically see effective ongoing afterwards see sustainable whether interaction continue done also sensing Technologies able provide u much individual level data going forward become affordable accessible think itll interesting able address question well near fixed equipment setting participant 11 toddler eight head typical development three special need two three child special need two speech delay one significant respiratory abdominal organ issue child spent approximately 42 minute playground three area playground first canopy area 29 ft 35 ft length grassy area contained Sandbox measured 56 ft wide 110 ft length edge canopy area created order could question intervention appear work really well kid great others question along line even data available like real time weather like adjustment could made improve intervention specific kid guess would practical level like teacher able use technology real time make adjustment yeah think open many new question u mean Ive done little bit work Daniels done looking Childrens friendship mean start look time child spending together talk develops childrens know move Playmates friend mean idea could used mean term think thinking peer mediate intervention intervention supporting guess dont know meaningful stronger relationship kid good question anybody found found anything upper limit number participant think far well within upper limit technical limitation here funny little picnic limitation movie sensor placed better knowing kind like think classroom term number student think theyre different approach issue Miami dont wear vest might hear vocalization true dont dont know child doesnt want work example saying Monday best yeah would say totally agree Daniel term number limit dependent mean many sensor need set dependent space like playground want get larger space know bigger playground sensor term number individual tag dont dont think limit mean least Adobe sound system worked past pretty robust mean developed industry theyre theyre using track like plane car storage yard movement people factory able handle able handle lot individual wearing tag havent heard restraint constraint really active system logistics start saying question kid wearing best wearing best Tiffany field collecting data right start weve piloting sensing system yet tomorrow really unobtrusive know use tshirts use fast even put necklace whatever pretty word dont get sense pretty obvious who wearing technology Dwight case Kansas tshirt know went back forth think like strap kind hit shoulder thats thats thinking using used vest insurance past thats totally fine mean couple year ago wanted get away thats thats know kid wearing GoPros kid arent probably affect lot thing classroom lot time feasibility mean pretty big as teacher say want come put sensor weve really spent lot time social validity want comment consent issue weve successful Ohio State weve social network couple year social network classroom really need represent whole classroom possible got 12 kid classroom really want participation 12 kid somehow biasing know representation social network lot luck passive consent last couple year mean well get active consent maybe know 10 15th well say parent dont return consent form still going collect certain data child passively think youre youre youre following footstep around past tense dont color kid want well end getting classroom one whatever know dont dirty used another classroom Zimmerman ask question bandwidth requirement ever supplement connectivity say work Ohio technology largely central Ohio connected connected internet thats issue mean connected laptop data thats connected power ethernet switch link sensor data come laptop go pick dont test know really active system dont think havent seen heard bandwidth issue think seems working well regard testing like attaching fourth class nicely locate child within outside canopy versus grassy area child tended something attended hang edge little bit error come along Ubisoft needed able place child correct area something really run classroom dont child moving space behind let see next picture canopy area give sense went sentence using zip tie connected CAT5 cord cool thing dont need Internet bad thing connect cable correctly funny issue system doesnt require talking outside world collecting data take lot time synchronize device log like timegov something team cant log timegov school like internet clock really important working multiple device trying seek question even comment get closing comment know going back Daniel saying invite join u know vision Ohio State think three Daniel found really nobody think shared Vision know way observational really really crude ought 2022 know going classroom watching 20 minute making sort global rating drawing really big inference tiny little snapshot think finding 202122 tool holding term predictive validity outcome know vision harness Technologies develop extremely rich deep understanding kid experience classroom hopefully get point identify one truly driving development really want develop realtime continuous control system know work Engineers expert control system maybe there sort visual teacher capturing real information kid instance Dwight Dwight isolated know precise level based data getting teacher react setting peer group Dwight going engage peer rest day know thats least part vision going move Beyond know exploration description truly designing Educational Tools used get 21st century classroom observation Daniel Dwight Tiffany last Vision see ice ice havent started audio pipeline yet Miami independently guy extolled virtue term know Pianist computer scientist kind like actually tell time actually accurate Weaver report historically get social network maybe three different way child report via typical peer nomination task teacher grid observation laying sensing data know ideally road need use social sensing data easy get go go Altman 2020 last question well going back mentioned Laura term going mean see like mentioned earlier Springs allows u get question think havent able get real good handle also think way take data collection burden teacher well start provide data focus whats know know remove element let u give back way easily interpretable make decision supporting kid setting classroom playground another thing think havent quite touched set system teacher put device know set hang potential exit minimal contact teacher student time living thats thats kind know important thing given covid mean tool offer u way potentially get data without somebody hang around classroom long period time pulling kid know assessment sort actually there actually people next day theyre actually looking disease transmitted classroom kid contact know isnt crazy think people road well wont call crazy difference generally excited see technology go future becomes accessible easy use affordable researcher going able really start painting complex understanding individual experience classroom know Im research technology thing exist detect thing like laughter sentiment keywords applied classroom really understand interaction child experiencing yeah right well think okay stop minute short 345 time thank everybody tuning Daniel white Tiffany really fabulous clear concise presentation great rest session everybody power ethernet switch laptop calibrated tool ensure sensor capturing tag position correctly used portable battery charge system powered well laptop use individual location tag replace around larger piece equipment youre seeing picture order look child inside area also examine talk took place behind structure different color wall like red yellow green there table set thats laptop,2
